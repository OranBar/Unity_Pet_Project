-Maybe instead of doing influence 1 on 1, do it on range waves. So you only compute the amount once, then apply it to all squares that are that distant from you.

-Figure out why the version of the code from the submit on codingame (jan 4,2019, 2:30AM) is not having timeout issues, while the new version is.
The new version has some adjustments I'd like to keep, like the expanding range, and others I can't remember.
